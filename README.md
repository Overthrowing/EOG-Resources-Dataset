## Resources

This repo contains data from leak events from a 24 hour window. All documents are csv files and any date/time data is in UTC.

The specific facility the data is drawn from is shown here:

## Files

```sensor_readings.csv```

This file gives the methane concentration readings for the 24 sensors at the facility. The unit of the concentration values is not important. Please note the sensors are effected by temperature and humidity. Every sensor has a unique key that gives a latitude and longitude within the key.

---

```leak_locations_and_rate.csv```

This file gives the latitude and longitude coordinates of known leak points or leak sources. A leak point for instance could be an oil storage tank or a pipe connection between equipment. Known leak rates of the leak points at the facility are also included. This data was captured for model calibration purposes.


Units:
- `LeakRate` - kg/h

---

```weather_data.csv```

This file provides weather data such as pressure, temperature, wind speed etc. at the facility during the 24 hour timeframe.

Units:
- Barometric Pressure - millibars (mb)
- Temperature - Celsius

[Here is an equation](https://courses.ecampus.oregonstate.edu/ne581/eleven/plume.htm) for the gaussian plume, use this to determine the plume generated by the leak and draw it on the map.
